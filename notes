typescript becomes superset of javascript and that is why javascript is tightly scripted and typescript is 
loosely scripted

Diff between BOM and DOM  ??
      They're just different objects you're dealing with:

  The DOM is the Document Object Model, which deals with the document, 
the HTML elements themselves, e.g. document and all traversal you would do in it, events, etc.
    The BOM is the Browser Object Model, which deals with browser components aside from the document,
 like history, location, navigator and screen (as well as some others that vary by browser).

DOM comes under BOM.
BOM cannot directly interfere with the webpage.
and interactions within the webpage is done with DOM.
